Alright fam this is the protocol:

Send:
 - key
    ~ key to write to in the KVS
 - value
    ~ value to write to in the KVS
 - payload

Payload (Client write):
 - value timestamp
    ~ timestamp from when the client did a GET
 - key vector clock
    ~ integer count of writes to this key by each view (dictionary)
 - hop list
    ~ list of nodes who have seen the payload

PUT:
 - Check the hop list
    ~ If not on, edit to include your node IP, then broadcast
    ~ If on, do not broadcast, just return
 - Compare the payload key-vector-clock to the node's key-vector-clock
    ~ If greater than, 
      - update node's kvs
    ~ If equal than,
      - compare payload timestamp to kvs key timestamp
        ~ if payload newer, update kvs
    ~ If less than
      - do nothing, it is old and ignored

SEARCH:
 - If key exists and delete flag is false
   ~ return payload with key contents
 - Else
   ~ return key does not exist

GET:
 - Compare payload vector clock with node's key vector clock
    ~ if greater
      - return 'Too Old'
    ~ else
      - return the value
