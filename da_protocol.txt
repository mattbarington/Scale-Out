Alright fam this is the protocol:

Payload (Client write):
 - status
    ~ This is the status of the message (e.g. 200, 404, ...etc.)
 - key
    ~ key to write to in the KVS
 - value
    ~ value to write to in the KVS
 - value timestamp
    ~ timestamp from when the client did a GET
 - key lamport clock
    ~ integer count of writes to this key
 - hop list
    ~ list of nodes who have seen the payload

PUT:
 - Check the hop list
    ~ If not on, edit to include your node IP, then broadcast
    ~ If on, do not broadcast, just return
 - Compare the payload key-lamport-clock to the node's key-lamport-clock
    ~ If greater than, 
      - update node's key-lamport-clock
      - update value
    ~ If less than
      - do nothing, it is old and ignored

SEARCH:
 - return key, value, timestamp, key-lamport-clock

GET:
 - Compare key-lamport-clock to node's
    ~ if greater
      - return 'Too Old'
    ~
      - return the value
